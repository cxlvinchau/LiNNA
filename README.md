LiNNA
=====
**LiNNA (*Linear Neural Network Abstraction*)** is a Python library for abstracting feed-fordward
neural networks. The abstraction can then be used to speed up verification or
to gain insights about redundancies in the network.
The idea is to replace neurons by a linear combination of neurons
and thereby replace the overall size of the network.

For more information, we refer to the [LiNNA website]().
