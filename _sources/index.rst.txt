LiNNA
=====
**LiNNA (Linear Neural Network Abstraction)** is a Python library for abstracting feed-fordward
neural networks. The abstraction can then be used to speed up verification or
to gain insights about redundancies in the network. The core idea is to replace neurons by a
linear combination of neurons and thereby replace the overall size of the network.
